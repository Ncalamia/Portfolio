Personal Portfolio Website

	This is my personal/professional portfolio website. I had a lot of fun making it and learned a ton in the process.


Technologies Used

	Mostly HTMl and CSS. I did use JQuery for some interactive components of the site. I also implemented media queries to all of the pages for easy 	viewing on desktop, half screen, iPad, and mobile use. I used some CSS and JQuery to make things appear and disappear. I mostly used W3 schools 	for a resource.


Approach Taken

	1. I started by drawing up a wireframe on some paper.
	2. Then once all of the layouts and ideas for certain elements were done, I made my daily schedule.
	3. I started by laying out all of my HTML first.
	4. After that I added in Jquery and JS to make things work.
	5. Then I added CSS to everything.
	6. Finally I inserted media queries to make the site viewable on many different devices.

Installation Instructions

	None

Unsolved Problems

	It took forever to figur out how to deploy the site. I had my files in directories in my Portfolio directory. A major learning experience but I was determined to figure it out until I did. I just wish I could have been a little bit quicker and been able to add more content. Also using some of my hover elements can;t be used for mobile.
